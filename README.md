# Mode_Water_Arabian_Sea

This repository contains several notebooks to process and produce the figures from Font et al. (in review) - On Mode Water formation and erosion in the Arabian Sea: Forcing mechanisms, regionality, and seasonality in Ocean Sciences - EGU

## Repository content and output for the different notebooks:

- 01: Run the MWL algorithm to all Argo Floats
- 02: Run GOTM to all Argo Floats initial profiles with ERA5 collocated & Figure S1
- 03: Figure 1 & Figure 2
- 04: Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure S2
- 05: Figure 5
- 06: Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure S3, S4
- 07: Figure 8
- 08: Figure 9
  
## Data availability and supplementary software:
The Argo data used in this study is available by the International Argo Program and the national programs contributing to it for the domain 40–80 °E, -5–30 °N and between 2000-2023 (Argo, 2023). The MOM4p1-TOPAZ potential temperature, salinity, and oxygen data used in this study for the upper 250m and domain 35-80 °E, 0-30 °N, are available from Zenodo (Font & Vinaychandran, 2025). Bathymetry data is available by GEBCOCompilation Group (GEBCO, 2023).
